version note:

Modified by Zhenzi Yu. This version is used for test for MC/MD method. Three example are used: CAU-10, IRMOF-1, ZIF-8 (where ZIF-8 is Jianwen Jiang's ff; CAU-10 and IRMOF-10 is UFF4MOF)

This version is stable, but need lots of manual edit for input file.
1. framwork.lmps need to corrected according to templet. Because the script is based on len(line) to identify key;
2. npt.in need to modify according to charge/ dump etc.
3. VDW / pair need to generate manually (python script available writen by Zhenzi)
4. driting of COM may occur, not fixed.
5. specify core both in PACE.sh and mof_taxi.py


Also note that, the ff in ZIF-8 example for adsorption need to be rescaled ( please refer to related research)
