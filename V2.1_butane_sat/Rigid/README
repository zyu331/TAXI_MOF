version note:

Calculate Rigid structure adsorption.

Input:
- Three forcefield file for RASPA, adsorbate.def 
- CoRE cifs with DDEC charge (default setting, may cause error if you are using other system, easy fix, but count on youself to modify the code)
- Modify XXX part in Rigid.py 
- specify cycles in Rigid.py

Notes:
- use the generated supercell for Snapshot / MCMD calculation 
- if you change the cores in .sh, please check the number in mof_taxi.py accordingly  (search keyword '16')
- Average Chagre! (no worries if adsorbate has no charge as intraframework coul is negelected)
