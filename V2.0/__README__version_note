version note:

Modified by Zhenzi Yu. This version is used for developing highthroughput MC/MD for CoRE MOF, LAMMPS-INTERFACE.

This version is NOT stable, and known error includes:
1. unphysical volume change
2. all the mentioned problems in V1.0
3. data.framework need to be cleaned at each start.
4. addition problem in the LAMPPS-Restartcombine process, may due to the volume change, may also exist in V0.0

In all, though this version can run without "ERROR", it is not realiable, and zhenzi will fix this on V2.1
